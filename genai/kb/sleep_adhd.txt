----------
Circadian rhythm delays are common in ADHD, with 75% of adults reporting sleep-onset insomnia. Melatonin secretion patterns differ, contributing to evening alertness and morning fatigue. Sleep restriction to 7-8 hours and consistent wake times improve daytime functioning. Blue light reduction in evenings and morning light exposure help regulate circadian rhythms. Addressing sleep issues often produces greater functional improvement than targeting ADHD symptoms alone.

----------
Approximately 60-70% of adults with ADHD have at least one comorbid condition. Anxiety disorders (47%) and mood disorders (38%) are most prevalent. Learning differences and substance use disorders also show high comorbidity rates. Comprehensive assessment should screen for co-occurring conditions, as untreated comorbidities limit ADHD treatment effectiveness. Integrated treatment approaches addressing both ADHD and comorbid conditions produce the best long-term outcomes.

----------
The MTA Cooperative Study demonstrated that combined treatment (medication + behavioral therapy) produces superior outcomes compared to either approach alone for core ADHD symptoms. Recent longitudinal data shows that individuals receiving combined treatment maintain better functional outcomes into adulthood. Medication primarily addresses neurobiological aspects, while behavioral strategies build compensatory skills. Optimal dosing involves regular assessment of target symptom response and side effect monitoring.

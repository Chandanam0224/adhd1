----------
Emotional dysregulation affects approximately 70% of adults with ADHD, characterized by rapid mood shifts and rejection sensitivity. fMRI studies show amygdala hyperactivity and prefrontal-amygdala connectivity differences. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills adapted for ADHD demonstrate significant improvements in emotional control. Mindfulness-based interventions show promise, particularly when combined with medication. Early recognition of emotional triggers and implementation of coping strategies reduces functional impairment.

Aerobic exercise (30 minutes, moderate intensity) produces acute improvements in executive function lasting 2-3 hours. Omega-3 supplementation, particularly EPA-rich formulations, shows small but significant benefits for attention. Protein-rich breakfasts improve medication efficacy and sustained attention. Elimination diets show limited evidence, but some individuals report benefits from reducing processed foods. Combined lifestyle approaches work synergistically with conventional treatments.

# ADHD Support Conversational Assistant (Streamlit)

This repo contains a minimal Streamlit app to run a generative conversational assistant tailored for ADHD support.
It includes:
- `app.py`: Streamlit frontend and small backend logic (uses OpenAI API if you supply a key).
- `secrets.toml`: example secrets — **do not commit real keys**.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `PROCEDURE.md`: deployment steps and notes.

This is an MVP; extend with RAG, clinician review, and hardened safety flows before production.
